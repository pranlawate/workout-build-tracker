# BUILD-Style Beginner Training Specification (Source of Truth)

**Version:** 2.0 - Enhanced
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Custom Beginner Program

This document is the **authoritative source of information** for the web-based gym tracker. It defines training philosophy, structure, workouts, progression rules, and safety constraints. The tracker should reflect this logic exactly.

---

## 1. User Profile (Context for Program Logic)

* Training experience: Beginner (< 6 months)
* Primary goal: Steady muscle and strength gains with low injury risk
* Secondary goals: Improve posture, shoulder mobility, lower-back strength
* Schedule variability: 3–5 training days per week
* Session duration: ~60 minutes
* Equipment preference: Dumbbells, cables, free weights first; barbells after 8+ weeks
* Injury considerations:
  * Stiff shoulders (desk posture)
  * Weak legs
  * Weak lower back

---

## 2. Core Training Principles (Non-Negotiable)

* Training focus: Balanced muscle + strength (hypertrophy-oriented)
* Effort regulation: Always train with **2–3 Reps In Reserve (RIR 2–3)**
* No training to failure except bodyweight movements with explicit stop rules
* Form quality > load progression
* Stable exercise selection for 6–8 weeks
* Moderate weekly volume to allow recovery
* Track sleep, stress, and energy to identify regression patterns

---

## 3. Weekly Structure (Auto-Regulating)

The program consists of **three rotating workouts: A, B, C**.

### Rotation Logic:

* If 3 training days/week → A / B / C
* If 4 training days/week → A / B / A / C
* If 5 training days/week → A / B / C / A / B

Missed days are skipped without reshuffling. The next session continues the rotation.

### Rest Day Structure:

* **3 days/week:** Train Mon/Wed/Fri, rest Tue/Thu/Sat/Sun
* **4 days/week:** Train Mon/Tue/Thu/Fri, rest Wed/Sat/Sun
* **5 days/week:** Train Mon-Fri, rest Sat/Sun

### Active Recovery (Optional):

* 10-15 min walk on rest days
* Light stretching for shoulders/hips
* Foam rolling if sore

---

## 4. Daily Warm-Up Protocol (Mandatory)

Warm-ups are workout-specific to prep movement patterns:

### Workout A (Lower Focus + Horizontal Push):
1. Cat-Cow: 10 reps
2. Band Pull-Aparts: 15 reps
3. Goblet Squat (bodyweight): 10 reps
4. Hip Hinge Drill: 10 reps
5. Ramp-up Set: 50% weight × 10 reps of Goblet Squat

### Workout B (Posterior Chain + Vertical Pull):

2. Cat-Cow: 10 reps
3. Glute Bridges (bodyweight): 15 reps

---

## 6. Progression Rules (Core Logic)

### Double Progression Model

* Each exercise has a defined rep range
* User logs reps and RIR for each set
* Weight is increased **only when the top rep target is achieved on all sets** while maintaining RIR ≥ 2

Example:

* Target: 3 × 8–12
* Progression:
  * 10 / 11 / 11 → keep weight
  * 12 / 12 / 12 @ RIR ≥2 → increase load next session

No forced reps. No grinding.

### Exercise-Specific Weight Increments

**Large Compound Movements (+2.5kg):**
* Goblet Squat
* Dumbbell Bench Press
* Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift
* Split Squat
* Bulgarian Split Squat
* Hip Thrust
* Seated Cable Row
* Chest-Supported Row

**Small Isolation Movements (+1-1.25kg):**
* Dumbbell Lateral Raise
* Face Pull (cable stack)
* Incline Dumbbell Press

**Bodyweight Progressions:**
* **Push-ups:** Add 1-2 reps per workout until 20 reps, then add weight (weighted vest/backpack)
* **Plank:** Add 5-10 seconds per workout until 60s, then add weight on back
* **Dead Bug:** Add 1 rep/side per workout until 15 reps, then add tempo (slower movements)

---

## 7. Plateau Resolution Protocol

If stuck at same weight for 3+ consecutive workouts:

### Step 1: Form Check (Week 1)
* Reduce weight by 10%
* Focus on perfect form, full range of motion
* Film yourself if possible
* Ensure RIR is accurately assessed

### Step 2: Rep Manipulation (Week 2)
* Add 1-2 reps to target range (e.g., 8-12 becomes 10-14)
* Once hitting new top range consistently, return to original range with +2.5kg

### Step 3: Exercise Variation (Week 3)
Temporary substitute (return to original after 2-3 weeks):
* Goblet Squat → Front-Foot Elevated Split Squat
* DB Bench Press → Floor Press
* Cable Row → Single-Arm DB Row
* Split Squat → Reverse Lunges
* Bulgarian Split Squat → Walking Lunges

### Step 4: Deload (Week 4)
* If still stuck after variations, trigger deload week

---

## 8. Machine Usage Rule

Machines are permitted when:

* User is fatigued
* Form quality degrades
* Movement pattern is still being learned

Machine use is considered a **fatigue management strategy**, not a regression.

Examples:
* Lat Pulldown (Workout B)
* Cable Row (Workout A)
* Back Extension machine (Workout B)

---

## 9. Barbell Introduction Criteria (Future Phase)

Barbell lifts may replace dumbbell variations **only after minimum 8 weeks** of consistent training, if **ALL** criteria met:

### Strength Benchmarks:
- [ ] Goblet Squat: 3×12 @ 30kg+ (half bodyweight for 160lb person)
- [ ] DB RDL: 3×10 @ 20kg+ dumbbells
- [ ] DB Bench: 3×12 @ 25kg+ dumbbells
- [ ] Split Squat: 3×8 @ 15kg+ dumbbell per hand

### Mobility Checklist:
- [ ] No shoulder pain during overhead movements
- [ ] Can touch toes without rounding lower back excessively
- [ ] Hip hinge pattern clean (coach/video verified)
- [ ] No lower back pain after RDLs

### Barbell Exercise Substitutions (Phase 2):
* Goblet Squat → Barbell Back Squat (start with empty bar)
* DB RDL → Trap Bar Deadlift (easier on lower back than conventional)
* DB Bench Press → Barbell Bench Press
* Split Squat → Barbell Reverse Lunge

### Transition Protocol:
* **Week 1-2:** Perform BOTH dumbbell and barbell version (6 sets total per exercise)
* **Week 3-4:** Barbell only, start at bottom of rep range (e.g., 8 reps for 8-12 range)
* **Anytime:** Return to dumbbells if form breaks down or pain appears

---

## 10. Deload Protocol

### Auto-Trigger Conditions:

The tracker monitors and triggers deload when:

1. **Time-based:** Every 6–8 weeks since last deload
2. **Performance-based:** Weight/reps decreased on 2+ exercises in same workout
3. **Fatigue-based (NEW):** Fatigue score ≥8 for 2 consecutive workouts

### Fatigue Score Calculation (per workout):

* Low energy (<3/5): +2 points
* Poor sleep (<6hrs): +2 points
* High stress level: +1 point
* Moderate+ muscle soreness: +1 point
* Form quality rated "Poor": +2 points
* Pain/discomfort flagged: +3 points

**If score ≥8:** Yellow warning banner
**If score ≥8 for 2 consecutive workouts:** Auto-suggest deload

### Deload Types:

**Standard Deload (default):**
* Reduce total sets by 40–50% (3→2 sets, 2→1 set)
* Maintain current weights
* Emphasize perfect form
* Duration: 7 days

**Light Deload (for minor fatigue):**
* Reduce weight by 20%
* Keep sets same
* Focus on form and ROM
* Duration: 7 days

**Active Recovery Week (for injuries/pain):**
* Replace all exercises with mobility work
* No resistance training
* Light stretching, walking, foam rolling
* Duration: 7 days

### Manual Override Options:

* **Start Early:** User can manually trigger deload from settings anytime
* **Exit Early:** User can end deload before 7 days if feeling recovered
* **Postpone:** User can delay auto-trigger by 3 days
* **Dismiss:** Resets 6-week timer completely

## 11. Enhanced Tracking Metrics

Beyond weight/reps/RIR, the tracker logs:

### Per-Workout Metrics:
* Sleep hours last night (number)
* Stress level (Low/Medium/High)
* Energy before workout (1-5 scale)
* Muscle soreness (None/Mild/Moderate/Severe)

### Per-Exercise Metrics:
* Form quality self-rating (Good/OK/Poor)
* Range of motion achieved (Full/Partial)
* Pain/discomfort flag (Yes/No + location if yes)

### Weekly Summary Dashboard:
* Total training volume (sets × reps × weight)
* Average RIR across all sets
* Exercises where progression occurred
* Compliance rate (workouts completed / planned)
* Sleep quality trend
* Fatigue score trend

**Purpose:** Identify patterns like "I regress when sleep <6hrs" or "Shoulder pain appears when volume >16 sets/week"

* Exercise-specific weight increment rules
* Optional exercise flags (can skip without affecting completion)
* Deload state toggling (manual + automatic)
* Fatigue score calculation and warning system
* Sleep/stress/energy tracking per workout
