## 🚧 DESIGNED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Exercise History View with Charts
**Source:** `docs/design/2026-02-03-ui-ux-design.md` (Section 4, lines 186-229)

**Missing Components:**
- [ ] Visual progress charts (Canvas API)
  - Weight over time (last 8 sessions)
  - Line graph with markers
  - Date labels on X-axis
- [ ] Recent workout list
  - Last 3-5 sessions with date
  - Sets/reps/RIR display
  - Progress badge per session (🟢🔵🟡🔴)
- [ ] "View All History" button
  - Full session list screen
  - Infinite scroll or pagination
- [ ] Per-exercise export option

**Design Status:** Fully specified with ASCII mockups
**Implementation Status:** 0% complete (basic export exists, no UI)
**Priority:** Medium (useful for tracking, not critical)

---

### 2. Enhanced Tracking Metrics System
**Source:** `BUILD-SPECIFICATION.md` (Section 11, lines 374-398)

**Missing Components:**

#### Per-Workout Metrics:
- [ ] Sleep hours last night (number input)
- [ ] Stress level (Low/Medium/High dropdown)
- [ ] Energy before workout (1-5 scale slider)
- [ ] Muscle soreness (None/Mild/Moderate/Severe dropdown)

#### Per-Exercise Metrics:
- [ ] Form quality self-rating (Good/OK/Poor buttons)
  - Note: Automated detection exists via Performance Analyzer
  - Manual self-rating still valuable for subjective assessment
- [ ] Range of motion achieved (Full/Partial toggle)
- [ ] Pain/discomfort flag (Yes/No + location if yes)

#### Fatigue Score Calculation:
- [ ] Auto-calculate per workout:
  - Low energy (<3/5): +2 points
  - Poor sleep (<6hrs): +2 points
  - High stress: +1 point
  - Moderate+ soreness: +1 point
  - Form quality "Poor": +2 points
  - Pain flagged: +3 points
- [ ] Warning banner if score ≥8
- [ ] Auto-suggest deload if ≥8 for 2 consecutive workouts

**Design Status:** Fully specified with point system
**Implementation Status:** 0% complete
**Priority:** High (critical for preventing overtraining)

---

### 3. Weekly Summary Dashboard
**Source:** `BUILD-SPECIFICATION.md` (Section 11, lines 389-398)

**Missing Components:**
- [ ] Total training volume calculation (sets × reps × weight)
- [ ] Average RIR across all sets
- [ ] Exercises where progression occurred (count + list)
- [ ] Compliance rate (workouts completed / planned)
- [ ] Sleep quality trend (7-day average)
- [ ] Fatigue score trend (chart over 4 weeks)
- [ ] Pattern identification
  - "I regress when sleep <6hrs"
  - "Shoulder pain appears when volume >16 sets/week"

**Design Status:** Specified in BUILD spec
**Implementation Status:** 0% complete
**Priority:** Medium (analytics, not real-time critical)

1. **Enhanced Tracking Metrics** - Prevents overtraining, enables fatigue scoring

**Estimated Effort:** 1 development session

---

### Phase 2: Progress Visualization (Medium Priority)
3. **Exercise History Charts** - Visual feedback on trajectory

**Estimated Effort:** 1 development session

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Lower Priority)
4. **Weekly Summary Dashboard** - Pattern identification, trends
5. **Advanced Deload Logic** - Fatigue-based auto-triggers (requires Enhanced Tracking)

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 development sessions
