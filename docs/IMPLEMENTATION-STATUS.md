## 🚧 DESIGNED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Build/Maintenance Phase Integration
**Source:** `docs/plans/2026-02-14-build-maintenance-phase-integration-design.md`

**Status:** ✅ Completed (2026-02-14)

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ **PhaseManager Module** - Centralized coordinator for phase-aware behavior (read-only pattern)
- ✅ **Phase-Aware Progression** - Building shows weight suggestions, Maintenance shows tempo variations
- ✅ **Dynamic Deload Timing** - Building: 6 weeks, Maintenance: 4 weeks, Recovery: 2 weeks (designed)
- ✅ **Unlock Prioritization** - Maintenance prioritizes bodyweight/traditional exercises first
- ✅ **Tempo Suggestions** - "Try 3-1-2 tempo (pause at bottom)" in Maintenance phase
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive defensive programming with safe fallbacks

**Implementation Details:**
- Module: `js/modules/phase-manager.js` (new)
- Modified: `deload.js`, `unlock-evaluator.js`, `progression.js`, `app.js`
- Cache: v64
- Testing: See `docs/build-maintenance-phase-integration-test.md`

**What's NOT Included:**
- Recovery phase behavior (API designed, implementation deferred)
- Maintenance phase exercise rotation (separate future feature)
- Goal Quiz onboarding flow (still pending)

### Goal Quiz & Initial Setup
**Source:** `docs/archived/plans/2026-02-13/2026-02-12-exercise-progression-pathways-design.md` (lines 208-234)

**Status:** Designed but not implemented

**Planned Features:**
- ❌ **Q1: Training Experience** - Beginner/Some/Advanced (affects UI help level)
- 🟡 **Q2: Equipment Access** - Checkboxes for Gym/Dumbbells/Barbells/Mudgal/Bodyweight (partially implemented as settings toggles)
- ✅ **Q3: Training Goals** - Build muscle/Build strength/Both (✅ IMPLEMENTED as Build/Maintenance phase toggle)

**Current State:**
- Equipment toggles exist in Settings but don't affect exercise filtering
- Build/Maintenance phase toggle exists in UI and is NOW FUNCTIONAL (2026-02-14)

**Missing Implementation:**
- First-time onboarding quiz flow
- Experience level tracking and UI help level adjustment
- Equipment filtering logic for exercise options

### Maintenance Phase Exercise Rotation
**Source:** `docs/archived/plans/2026-02-13/2026-02-12-exercise-progression-pathways-design.md` (lines 263-279)

**Status:** Partially implemented

**Planned Behavior:**
- In Maintenance phase: Rotate accessory exercises every 4-6 weeks while keeping primary exercises fixed
- Building phase: Fixed exercises (current behavior)
- ✅ Maintenance phase: Different deload frequency (4-6 weeks vs 6-8 weeks) - IMPLEMENTED (2026-02-14)
- Unlock prioritization by exercise type - IMPLEMENTED (2026-02-14)

**Current State:**
- ✅ Deload frequency adapts to phase (6 weeks Building, 4 weeks Maintenance)
- ✅ Unlock priority favors bodyweight exercises in Maintenance
- ❌ No accessory rotation logic implemented (future enhancement)

### Dynamic Mobility Checks
**Source:** `docs/archived/plans/2026-02-13/2026-02-11-dynamic-mobility-checks-design.md`

- `mobility-patterns.js` (exercise-to-pattern mapping)
- Movement pattern categories (vertical_push, hip_hinge, squat_pattern, etc.)
- Self-learning system that adds/removes checks based on performance + pain patterns

**Current State:**
- Hardcoded mobility checks for 3 exercises only (DB Shoulder Press, Goblet Squat, DB RDL)
- No adaptive behavior - checks never graduate or expand

### Advanced Exercise Progression Tracking
**Source:** `docs/archived/plans/2026-02-13/2026-02-12-exercise-progression-pathways-design.md`

**Status:** ✅ Completed (2026-02-13)

- All 4 categories display readiness percentage
- Tracking: Strength milestones, training weeks, mobility checks, pain-free status
- Cache: v64 (updated 2026-02-14 for phase integration)

## 📜 Design Evolution & Decision History

**Purpose:** Track what was decided, rejected, transformed, and pending to prevent future confusion

### Major Design Decisions

#### 1. Training Split Structure (2026-02-02 → 2026-02-03)

**Initial Design (2026-02-02):**
- Full Body A/B/C rotation (3 workouts)
- Source: `data-model-design.md`
- Each workout: Lower push, Lower pull, Upper push, Upper pull, Core, Mobility

**Pivoted To (2026-02-03):**
- Upper/Lower Split (4 workouts: UPPER_A, LOWER_A, UPPER_B, LOWER_B)
- Source: `mvp-implementation-plan.md`
- Upper days: Only upper body exercises; Lower days: Only lower body exercises

**Rationale:**
- Better muscle recovery for beginners (48-hour rest per muscle group)
- More manageable session volume
- Clearer exercise organization

**Status:** ✅ Implemented, ❌ BUILD-SPECIFICATION.md never updated (still describes A/B/C)

**Overall Implementation Rate:** 85% (17 fully implemented, 1 partial, 1 not implemented, 1 superseded)

---

### What Was REJECTED (Explicit Design Decisions Against Implementation)

**None found.** All designed features either implemented fully, partially implemented, or left incomplete without documented rejection.

---

### What Was TRANSFORMED (Partially Implemented)

#### 1. Exercise Progression Pathways (2026-02-12)
**Original Design:** 4 categories + Goal Quiz + Phase integration
**What Got Implemented:**
- ✅ Barbell exercises (Bench Press, Back Squat, Deadlift)
- ✅ Traditional bodyweight (Sadharan Dand, Sadharan Baithak)
- ✅ Pull-up progressions (2026-02-13)
- ✅ Mudgal/Club progressions (2026-02-13)

**What's Still Missing:**
- ❌ Goal Quiz (Q1: Experience, Q2: Equipment, Q3: Goals)
- ❌ Build/Maintenance phase logic integration
- ❌ Maintenance phase exercise rotation

#### 2. Equipment Access & Phase Toggles (2026-02-12)
**Original Design:** Quiz-based onboarding flow
**What Got Implemented:** Settings toggles exist
**What Doesn't Work:** Toggles don't affect any app behavior
**Status:** Storage-only features (misleading - appear functional but aren't)

---

### What's PENDING (Ready for Implementation)

All incomplete features properly documented in "DESIGNED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED" section above.

**High-Value Pending Features:**
1. Goal Quiz - Personalized onboarding for new users
2. Build/Maintenance Phase Integration - Make existing toggles functional
3. Dynamic Mobility Checks - Adaptive system vs hardcoded checks
4. Maintenance Exercise Rotation - Variety for long-term users
